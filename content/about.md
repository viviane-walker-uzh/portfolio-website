## About This Website

This is a website motivated to get bonus points[^1] in a course at the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html). The course is called [Programming Techniques in Computational Lingustics 2](https://studentservices.uzh.ch/uzh/anonym/vvz/?sap-language=EN&sap-ui-language=EN#/details/2021/004/SM/50941577) and the task was to build a portfolio website with GitHub Pages and have a link to a coding project.


*Disclaimer*: This hugo theme is based on the resume template ["Research"](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-researcher/) **by Oliver Roques**. Thank you very much. -> Visit [ GitHub](https://github.com/ojroques/hugo-researcher) to find the full source code.
## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="female.jpg" alt="female">}}

Hi there, my name is Viviane Walker. I am a student at the University of Zurich. Currently I am enrolled in my Bachelor Studies of Social Sciences with a Minor in Computational Lingustics and Language Technology. And this website experience, especially with Github and Hugo was quite pleasant and I am looking forward to modify my website even further. Also, feel free to [send me some feedback](mailto:viviane.walker@uzh.ch).

## This could be another section

This could be the description or the text for an additional section on this portfolio website. For example, I could link my CV or some other document. Or I could insert some python3 code snippets like this:









[^1]: for 0.25 bonus points: you built a simple portfolio. That is, simple landing page and a projects section/tab with a link to a coding project. // for 0.50 bonus points: your portfolio consists of at least a landing page and a projects section/tab with a link to a coding project. Plus, there is an obvious extra effort on building a nice portfolio.
