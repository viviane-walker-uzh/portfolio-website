## About This Website

This is a website motivated to get bonus points[^x] in a course at the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html). The course is called [Programming Techniques in Computational Lingustics 2](https://studentservices.uzh.ch/uzh/anonym/vvz/?sap-language=EN&sap-ui-language=EN#/details/2021/004/SM/50941577) and the task was to build a portfolio website with GitHub Pages and have a link to a coding project.


*Disclaimer*: This hugo theme is based on the resume template ["Research"](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-researcher/) **by Oliver Roques**. Thank you very much. -> Visit [ GitHub](https://github.com/ojroques/hugo-researcher) to find the full source code.
## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="female.jpg" alt="female">}}

Hi there :)  
My name is Viviane Walker. I am a student at the University of Zurich. Currently I am enrolled in my Bachelor Studies of Social Sciences with a Minor in Computational Lingustics and Language Technology. And this website experience, especially with Github and Hugo was quite adventurous - because I never created a website entirely by myself - and I am looking forward to modify this website even further. Also, feel free to [send me some feedback](mailto:viviane.walker@uzh.ch).


## Coding Projects

 >>>[Click here](http://viviane-walker-uzh.github.io/portfolio-website/projects/) or click on the Projects tab in the header above to discover my previous coding projects. Enjoy :) 

## How I got from the template to this
1. first things first, download the template from the [Hugo Template Website](https://gohugo.io/templates/) after that set up git, connect to GitHub.
2. get all necessary files into the upmost directory stage from the exampleSite folder. Change all necessary infos in the config.toml file (very essential file).
3. modify, add and delete content for desired output
4. Also, for fun I added a new Avatar AND I created a favicon.ico, but I am still struggling to insert it into the github Pages. I did work though on localhost..
5. of course, do not forget the command *hugo* in the terminal before adding, committing and pushing all made changes.
6. upload [Coding Projects](https://viviane-walker-uzh.github.io/portfolio-website/projects/) into a new repository on GitHub. For this I added two examples. [One from this semester](https://github.com/viviane-walker-uzh/Coding-Projects-PCL2-Exercises) and one example from [last semester](https://github.com/viviane-walker-uzh/Coding-Projects-PCL1-spaCy).
7. Finally, link Coding Projects in the *Projects* tab, and commit and push final changes.
8. hand-in link to lecturer and crossed fingers for a bonus :)) thanks for reading <3


[^x]: **for 0.25** bonus points: you built a simple portfolio. That is, simple landing page and a projects section/tab with a link to a coding project. // **for 0.50** bonus points: your portfolio consists of at least a landing page and a projects section/tab with a link to a coding project. Plus, there is an obvious extra effort on building a nice portfolio.
